MORPH GRID: 
Use the parent class morph-grid to contain grid-items.
- The grid items will have a thumbnail and a section for full content.
- When hovered, the initially showing thumbnail will morph into the expanded content while keeping the thumbnail on the left.

<div class="morph-grid" >
    <div class="grid-item">
        <div class="content">Thumbnail</div>
        <div class="expanded-content">Full content</div>
    </div>
</div>
