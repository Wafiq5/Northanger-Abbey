                        Catherine Morland, a young and somewhat naive girl with a love for Gothic novels, is invited to
                        visit Bath, where she meets the charming Henry Tilney and his sister, Eleanor. During her time
                        in Bath, she becomes friends with the Tilneys and eventually receives an invitation to stay at
                        Northanger Abbey, their family estate. Excited by the mysterious atmosphere of the Abbey and
                        influenced by the Gothic novels she loves, Catherine begins to imagine that the Abbey holds
                        hidden secrets. However, her adventurous imagination and assumptions about the family’s past
                        lead her to misunderstand the reality of her situation. As Catherine navigates her feelings for
                        Henry and her growing awareness of the world around her, she learns that things are not always
                        as they seem.
