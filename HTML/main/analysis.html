                    Northanger Abbey is a novel written by Jane Austen in the last few years of the 18th century. The
                    book
                    was written as a satire of Gothic literature, in that there are some Gothic story elements that are
                    flipped or used as plot points to further satirize Gothic literature.
                    <br><br>
                    In the beginning of the book, we are introduced to the protagonist and heroine Catherine. Catherine
                    lives with her mother, father, and siblings. Catherine was not like other girls, in that she
                    preferred
                    athletic activities and educated herself using Gothic novels. At the age of 17, she was invited by
                    her
                    neighbors, Mr and Mrs Allen, to Bath, England.

                    It is at Bath where we meet the first antagonist, John Thorpe, along with his sister, Isabella
                    Thorpe. John is an antagonist because he attempts to ruin Catherine’s relationship with another
                    character, Henry Tilney. While John is brash and very informal, Henry is very conversational and
                    gentle. Henry’s sister, Eleanor, is also a foil of Isabella. Isabella is overly dramatic and aids
                    John in completing his plans, while Eleanor is calm and thoughtful. After spending several weeks in
                    Bath, Catherine leaves with Henry, Eleanor, and their father, General Tilney, to Northanger Abbey.

                                some task. In this case, John’s task would be to marry Catherine. Unfortunately, he
                                fails, and instead tries to sabotage Catherine’s relationship with Henry and General
                                Tilney.

                    Once at the Abbey, Catherine’s mind begins racing with wild Gothic ideas. Due to this, she begins
                    thinking that she is in a Gothic story, given the gothic setting. It is this thought that leads her
                    to believe that General Tilney murdered his own wife. However, this is proven false by Henry Tilney,
                    who then begins questioning Catherine's ideas and mentality. After ten days, General Tilney suddenly
                    kicks Catherine out of the Abbey for no given reason.

                                Catherine educated herself through several Gothic novels, so her mindset would be
                                centered around Gothic tropes and elements. Thus, it would be easy for her to see a
                                Gothic setting as being the setup for a Gothic story, since a Gothic setting is what
                                makes a Gothic story truly Gothic.

                <div class="analysis-title subtitle">What is the central idea that Northanger Abbey explores?</div>
                <div class="analysis-author">By Thomas Nguyen</div>
                <div class="analysis-paragraph">
                    Catherine Morland’s character development directly communicates the novel’s themes of love and
                    loyalty through her shifting perceptions and relationships. Austen doesn’t deliver these themes
                    through grand declarations but through Catherine’s subtle, often awkward growth, which strengthens
                    the message.<br><br>

                    Initially, Catherine’s view of love is distorted by her obsession with Gothic novels. Her delusions
                    regarding the general in chapters 20 through 23 prove this. In chapter 20, after Catherine asks for
                    confirmation for what an Abbey is, Henry responds with, “‘No, certainly. We shall not have to
                    explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire—nor be obliged to
                    spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware
                    that when a young lady is (by whatever means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always
                    lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the house,
                    she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase and along
                    many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty
                    years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you when you find
                    yourself in this gloomy chamber—too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a
                    single lamp to take in its size—its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life,
                    and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funeral appearance? Will not
                    your heart sink within you?’”<br><br>

                    This tease by Henry Tilney causes Catherine’s imagination to go wild in chapter 21 where she
                    believes that the Abbey holds some deep secret locked within a chest, and in chapter 23, where she
                    believes the general killed his wife, “Mrs. Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and
                    receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the conclusion
                    which necessarily followed.” This wild imagination can imply she also views relationships the same
                    way. She expects relationships to mirror fiction’s dramatic beats, misreading Henry Tilney’s
                    sarcastic humor as mysterious charm and later imagining General Tilney as a villain. These mistakes
                    aren’t just comic; they reveal a deeper problem, which is that she’s loyal to fantasies, but not
                    people. Her growth begins when reality interrupts—Henry calls out her absurd accusation against his
                    father not with anger, but baffled amusement. This moment underscores Austen’s point: real love
                    requires seeing others clearly, not projecting ideals onto them.<br><br>

                    Loyalty, too, is tested through contrast. Isabella Thorpe acts as Catherine’s foil, performing
                    friendship while manipulating everyone for personal gain. When Isabella drops Catherine’s brother
                    for a wealthier man, the betrayal highlights Catherine’s quiet integrity. After Catherine reads the
                    letter sent to her by Isabella in chapter 27, “Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose
                    even upon Catherine. Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the very
                    first. She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever loved her,” implies that she had
                    integrity and was honest. Would you be this ashamed of others if you have the qualities you view as
                    scornful? Even when General Tilney kicks her out for lacking fortune, Catherine doesn’t fight back.
                    Austen’s message is clear: true loyalty means consistency, not convenience.<br><br>

                    The social context sharpens these themes. In a world where marriage is transactional, embodied by
                    John Thorpe’s boasting, evident in chapter nine, where he boasts about his horse, “‘You will not be
                    frightened, Miss Morland,’ said Thorpe, as he handed her in, “if my horse should dance about a
                    little at first setting off. He will, most likely, give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest
                    for a minute, but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there
                    is no vice in him,”” and General Tilney’s greed, which is shown by the general kicking Catherine out
                    of the Abbey because she wasn’t rich. This is implied by the last lines in the book, “an accession
                    of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour,” which made him accept the marriage between
                    Henry Tilney, and Catherine. Henry and Catherine’s bond stands out because it’s built on mutual
                    respect. Henry doesn’t love her despite her naivety but helps her move beyond it. Their relationship
                    argues that love isn’t about grand gestures but daily honesty, a radical idea in a status-obsessed
                    society.<br><br>

                    Catherine’s arc concludes not with perfection but perspective. She stops seeing life as a Gothic
                    novel and starts valuing people as they are. The themes resonate because Catherine’s mistakes are
                    relatable and her progress gradual. Love and loyalty, the novel insists, aren’t about dramatic
                    sacrifices but the choices we make when no one’s watching.

                <div class="analysis-title subtitle">How big of an effect does the historical setting with its strict
                    social rules and etiquette have on the development of the characters and plot?</div>
                <div class="analysis-author">By Thomas Nguyen</div>
                <div class="analysis-paragraph">
                    The story of Northanger Abbey takes place during the Regency era, a time when strict social rules
                    and etiquette influenced every aspect of daily life. This period not only affected how characters
                    spoke and behaved but also had a significant impact on the plot and the development of the
                    characters. These etiquette rules don’t just affect the way people talk to each other, but are a
                    reflection of the status-based society in the Regency era, and leave a deep impact on the character
                    development of Catherine Morland.<br><br>

                    We are introduced to Catherine Morland as a young average woman, not stunning in appearance, nor in
                    behavior. But as she grew older, when Catherine reached her teens, she started to care about her
                    looks, and grew into a, “quite a good-looking girl” as said by her parents. She goes to Bath, a big
                    change of setting from home, and meets Mrs. Allen, who is always concerned with her own appearances.
                    This behavior can indirectly communicate the values of outward appearance in the Regency era to
                    Catherine who has not really cared about appearances much in her life.<br><br>

                    At a ball, a lady had to wait for a gentleman to ask her to dance with him, but the lady had to have
                    some acquaintance with that gentleman, otherwise, the gentleman needed someone, like a Master of
                    Ceremonies, to introduce him to her. This is shown in chapter three, “The master of the ceremonies
                    introduced to her a very gentleman-like young man as a partner; his name was Tilney,” where Henry
                    Tilney was introduced by the Master of Ceremonies before asking Catherine to dance with him. This
                    can introduce to Catherine Morland more of the importance of outward appearance in the Regency
                    era.<br><br>

                    Another major aspect of Regency etiquette is how women are expected to maintain their reputations by
                    following strict rules. Catherine, like other young women, is not allowed to go out on her own, and
                    her actions are under constant scrutiny. Isabella Thorpe, however, pushes these boundaries,
                    manipulating the rules to her advantage, “The progress of the friendship between Catherine and
                    Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every
                    gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their
                    friends or themselves,” the speed at which the friendship developed can imply that Isabella could’ve
                    bent some rules and manipulated Catherine to speed up the friendship. John Thorpe takes advantage of
                    this by lying about Catherine’s plans, “‘Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road,
                    driving a smart-looking girl,’” making it seem like she agreed to something she did not. Because of
                    the rigid social rules, Catherine cannot openly contradict him without causing a scene. This shows
                    how these rules not only dictate behavior but also give certain people the power to control
                    others.<br><br>

                    Marriage, in this period, is similarly influenced by social expectations. It is less about love and
                    more about status. General Tilney, for example, thought Catherine was wealthy and encouraged her
                    relationship with Henry through John Thorpe, “John Thorpe had first misled him.” When he finds out
                    that she is not rich, he promptly distances himself from her. His reaction reinforces the idea that
                    marriage during the Regency era was often treated as a financial transaction, not a personal choice.
                    Catherine, however, rejects this idea. She values genuine affection over wealth, and her eventual
                    marriage to Henry underscores Austen’s critique of a society that prioritizes money over true
                    connection.<br><br>

                    Regency etiquette also complicates honest communication. Since people are expected to be polite
                    rather than direct, emotions and intentions are often concealed under a veil of proper conversation.
                    Catherine, for instance, misinterprets Isabella’s dramatic expressions of friendship, thinking they
                    are sincere. She also lets her imagination run wild when she suspects that Northanger Abbey hides
                    dark secrets, but the real deception is in the everyday social performances, where words and actions
                    do not always align. Through these experiences, Catherine learns that appearances can be
                    deceiving.<br><br>

                    The rigid social rules of the Regency era shape Catherine’s entire journey. They determine how she
                    interacts with others, how she interprets the world, and how she matures over the course of the
                    story. Northanger Abbey is not just a parody of Gothic novels; it’s a story about navigating a
                    society where etiquette governs everything, often at the expense of the truth.

                <div class="analysis-title subtitle">The Power of Appeals in Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey</div>
                <div class="analysis-author">By Ahmad Sadid Wafiq</div>
                <div class="analysis-paragraph">
                    Jane Austen employs various rhetorical appeals—humor, irony, sentimentality, and moral critique—to
                    enhance the emotional depth of Northanger Abbey. Through her skillful use of pathos (emotional
                    appeal), ethos (moral credibility), and logos (logic and satire), she both engages readers and
                    critiques societal expectations, particularly through the journey of her protagonist, Catherine
                    Morland.<br><br>

                    One of Austen’s most effective tools is humor, particularly satire, which she uses to parody gothic
                    novels. Catherine’s overactive imagination, influenced by her love of The Mysteries of Udolpho,
                    leads her to suspect General Tilney of imprisoning and possibly murdering his wife. Her dramatic
                    investigation of the late Mrs. Tilney’s supposed confinement is both comical and revealing,
                    showcasing how gothic literature distorts her perception of reality. Austen uses this exaggeration
                    not only to entertain but also to contrast Catherine’s imagination with the mundane truth—that Mrs.
                    Tilney simply died of illness. This clever irony underscores Austen’s broader critique of
                    sensationalist fiction and appeals to logic, urging readers to recognize the distinction between
                    fantasy and reality.<br><br>

                    Catherine’s emotional journey also provides a strong appeal to pathos. Her trusting nature makes her
                    susceptible to the manipulations of Isabella Thorpe, whose cunning and self-interest become evident
                    through her flirtation with Captain Tilney despite her engagement to Catherine’s brother, James. The
                    revelation of Isabella’s duplicity is a turning point for Catherine, marking her transition from an
                    impressionable girl to a more discerning young woman. This emotional betrayal, coupled with
                    Catherine’s quiet heartbreak over Henry Tilney’s potential disapproval, elicits deep sympathy from
                    readers and reinforces the novel’s theme of maturation and self-awareness. Her evolution from
                    naivety to discernment is not just a plot device but a testament to Austen’s nuanced
                    characterization.<br><br>

                    Additionally, Austen employs ethos to critique societal norms, particularly concerning marriage and
                    social ambition. General Tilney’s initial hospitality towards Catherine is not based on genuine
                    kindness but on his mistaken belief that she is an heiress. When he discovers her lack of fortune,
                    he unceremoniously expels her from Northanger Abbey, an act of calculated cruelty that reveals his
                    materialistic nature. This harsh treatment highlights the rigid class structures of Austen’s era and
                    exposes the moral bankruptcy of those who prioritize wealth over personal virtue. Meanwhile, Henry
                    Tilney’s choice to defy his father and propose to Catherine despite her modest means underscores the
                    novel’s ethical argument: true character and affection should triumph over financial
                    considerations.<br><br>

                    Finally, Austen plays with suspense and gothic elements to momentarily engage readers in feelings of
                    fear and intrigue, only to subvert their expectations. Catherine’s midnight excursions through
                    Northanger Abbey’s dimly lit corridors and her discovery of a mysterious chest build tension
                    reminiscent of The Castle of Otranto, yet the only shocking revelation inside the chest is an old
                    laundry list. This deliberate anticlimax humorously dismantles gothic tropes,
